## Notes
<!-- This section is for students to place their notes -->

When you commit, you place in local repo, where operations are performed. 
Class repo is read only, and can't push.
Commit to local repo, but can't push up.
Git push won't make notes disappear. 
History is itself.
You can't change history, but you can remove it from repo.
Last time, we discussed 
- ISO/OSI model, which had seven layers. (What each layer does(1-4) to send message)
-     What each layer does (layer 1-4) to send message; each layer calls what it sends differently.
-        layer 1: symbols; layer 2: frames; layer 3: packet; layer 4: segment; layer N: data
-  Brief overview of IP packet: binary bits that chopped into fields
- 4 theoretical machines: Turing Machine, Linear Bounded Automata, Pushdown Automata, Finite State Machine
- Boolean Algebra: 3 primary operations: AND, NOT, OR. 
-  Can build more interesting operations with them (xor, half-adder)
-  4 types of languages: recursively enumerable, context-sensitive, context-free, regular expressions
- MIPS differs from ARM, and = example of physical architecture.   
- Universal Computer
-  Tape/machine that is large enough for calculations
-  control unit <=> firmware
-  input from I/O device
-  OS on tape/memory
-  Program on tape/memory
-  input/output from external device

When you program, you look at problem. 
Windows is case insensitive unlike most computers.

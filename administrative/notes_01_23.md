# Today's Material

  * Why Unix/Linux?  It is philosophical!
    ```
    The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, compact, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators.
    ```

  * Why an emphasis on collaborative tools?
    - Technological Systems are built, maintained, and deployed by teams
    - Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver
    - The Agile Manifesto 
      1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      1. Working software over comprehensive documentation
      1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
      1. Responding to change over following a plan

  * Consequences of the Agile Approach
    1. Constantly look for new processes and tools to be more effective as a team!
    1. Use documentation as a guide, don't presume the "spec" is always right -- but fix it when it is wrong.
    1. Focus on current needs to solve problems, don't focus a rehashing previous (mis)understandings.
    1. Except what is expected to change: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome!
